Q2 Create a PHP program that consists of two forms: one using the GET method to search for an item in a list
(e.g., grocery list), and another using the POST method to add a new item to the list. After the new item is added
via POST, it should appear in the results of the GET search. Ensure both functionalities are working on the same
page.
